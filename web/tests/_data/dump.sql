The box, found in the Department of Archaeology and Anthropology, was filled with pottery, seeds and animal bones. Index cards nestled among the objects, with keywords such as &lsquo;Predynastic&rsquo;, &lsquo;Sargonid&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Royal Tombs&rsquo; written on them, suggested the remains came from the excavations made by Sir Leonard Woolley in southern Iraq at the site of Ur during the 1920s and early 1930s. &nbsp; Some of the items found Environmental finds were rarely collected in this period, especially from this part of the world. &nbsp; The collection will now be sent to the British Museum, where they will join the rest of the museum&rsquo;s collection from Ur The original excavation was sponsored jointly by the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum, and the finds were divided between London, Philadelphia and Baghdad. Dr Tamar Hodos, senior lecturer in archaeology at Bristol, said the remaining puzzle was how the collection made its way to Bristol in the first place. &ldquo;The environmental remains themselves were published in 1978 in Journal of Archaeological Science. The authors of that study were based at the Institute of Archaeology, London, and at the University of Southampton, and none of them had any known connection to the University of Bristol that might explain how the material came to reside here. If anyone can shed light on this mystery, we would love to hear from them,&rdquo; Dr Hodos said.

In 10 to 15 years time, I fear we could live to regret this decision. The design is not good for young children, it is very corporate. But we are over the barrel here,&rdquo; she said.\r\nCllr Wright added: &ldquo;The best schools in the country, the independent schools, all have buildings centuries old. But the reality is you have to pay money to keep up the old buildings, and the state system has never been enamoured in keeping old buildings.\r\n&ldquo;I am not happy with what&rsquo;s before us, but we have no choice. We have an education emergency in this city. We would be pushing things back years if we reject this plan and we don&rsquo;t have years.&rdquo;\r\nChair Cllr Woodman said his &ldquo;heart said no but my head says yes&rdquo; on the application, but said before abstaining on the vote: &ldquo;I do think the new design is hideous and drab.&rdquo;\r\nCouncillors eventually voted seven in favour of the plans (Cllrs Richard Eddy, Fi Hance, Mahmadur Khan, Olly Mead, Kevin Quartley, Colin Smith and Rob Telford), with two abstentions (Cllrs Alex Woodman and Mark Wright).

In a bid to educate children on healthy lifestyles, and thus prevent health problems including diabetes and obesity in later life, 2,000 eight- to 10-year-olds in 60 schools across the region were given new lesson plans and interactive homework activities. Teachers were given special training to implement healthy eating and lifestyle lessons in the Active for Life Year 5 (AFLY5) intervention, while letters and newsletters were sent to parents to inform them and encourage them to take part. But the team led by Professor Debbie Lawlor at the University of Bristol found no evidence that the work did anything to increase the time children spent doing moderate to vigorous physical activity, reduce the amount of sedentary time, or increase the amount of fruit and vegetables they ate. They did find though that children spent less time in front of a television or computer screen at weekends and also ate and drank fewer snacks and high energy drinks. The team conclude that, unlike prevailing theories that healthy lifestyles can be taught effectively in schools, a more fundamental approach needs to be taken across society and involving families far more. According to the World Health Organization, in 2010 three out of 10 children aged two to 15 were obese in the UK. Exercise for elderly pays off Older people who undertake at least 25 minutes of moderate or vigorous exercise every day need fewer prescriptions and are less likely to be admitted to hospital in an emergency, new research has revealed. In the first study of its kind looking at this age group, researchers from the University of Bristol looked at data from 213 people whose average age was 78. Those who carried out less than 25 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per day &ndash; such as walking quickly, cycling or swimming &ndash; received 50% more prescriptions over the following four to five years than those who were more active. The research &ldquo;underlines that keeping older people active brings a whole range of health benefits, as well as reducing reliance on the NHS and potentially leading to major cost savings&rdquo;, said Professor Ken Fox from the university&rsquo;s Centre for Exercise, Nutrition and Health Sciences.','','BS4 3EN','51.47358020325013','-2.5415048945068293',NULL,NULL,1,1,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-03 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','2014-07-03 03:52:08'),

The two-year project will transform the stadium into a 27,000 capacity ground. In November last year, councillors gave unanimous backing to Bristol Sport&rsquo;s plans to renew the ground which designers said would turn a &ldquo;relic of bygone era&rdquo; to a &ldquo;beacon of growth for the city&rdquo;. The development includes the demolition and rebuilding of the Williams Stand and Wedlock Stand, a remodelled Dolman Stand, and alterations to the Atyeo Stand and concourse. Building work is expected to be completed in 2016, with work on installing a new pitch already under way. Andrew Billingham, CEO of Bristol Sport, admitted it is a complex project despite the big ambitions. &ldquo;We want this stadium to be a beacon for sport and entertainment in the South West. Obviously having Bristol Rugby and Bristol City Football Club playing here from August will contribute to that, but we also have a vision of it becoming a venue of choice for conferences and major events. &ldquo;Bristol has been under sold for too long and it is time to build something that we can be truly proud of.&rdquo; Bristol City FC&rsquo;s majority shareholder Steve Lansdown said in January the club would push ahead with plans to redevelop Ashton Gate &ndash; finally killing off proposals to build a new stadium at Ashton Vale.

The southern &ldquo;wetlands&rdquo; area would remain registered as a town green which means no development would be allowed there.

Fittingly, there was another event for a large crowd of boozed up and suited City types on the top floor &ndash; I glimpsed it briefly as the lift took me up instead of down, and the atmosphere couldn&rsquo;t have been more different. The top floor smelled of testosterone, was roaringly loud, overwhelmingly white, mostly male and had the edginess of fast moving people and alcohol. Not a place for the timid. When eventually delivered to the basement, there was an entirely different feel. It was buzzing with conversation at a comfortable volume, crammed with all kinds of people from the very young to the very old, and incredibly welcoming as so many smiled in the direction of new arrivals. It too hot, but when people started fanning themselves, it was noticable that several also fanned those around them. Within minutes, I found myself swept up in the enthusiasm of Fatima Ayub from Bradford who&rsquo;s passion for looking after others by volunteering over the past 20 years was incredibly infectious. I was then delighted to meet Heather Wheeler, who gives free haircuts for people in a hospice up in Stafford. She&rsquo;d raised over &pound;20,000 for the hospice and we chatted about the huge potential hairdressers have to get people thinking more about ways of increasing happiness. The editor of the Independent Lisa Markwell, said how she&rsquo;d arrived in post as the list was published last year, and described the impression made by the Happy List as amazing and inspiring. It was clearly the kind of journalism which made her job feel really worthwhile. Nick Hurd, Minister for Civil Society, added his own fulsome praise about the value of the contributions Happy Listers make to society. He felt the Happy List was far more important than the Rich List and noted with a grin that none of the rich are ever really happy because there&rsquo;s always someone richer than them. It was the first time in 7 years of Happy List publications that The Independent had gathered their happiness champions together, and the energy was fantastic. Drawing attention to people who do inspirational things is clearly a very worthwhile thing to do &ndash; bringing them together is powerful in quite a different way. There&rsquo;s a sense of almost irresistable momentum about the way such a positive crowd invites others to step up and get involved. I&rsquo;d been invited because of the city based Happy List we&rsquo;d created in Bristol last year, and our plans to help develop city lists all around the country with in partnership with the originator of the idea, David Randall. Our discussions are moving on apace, and with another national partner with superb local community connections in the wings, we hope to be reporting on a string of celebrations from Truro to Aberdeen by this time next year. One thing&rsquo;s for sure &ndash; the Happy List has come of age. It&rsquo;s got the potential to shift the nation&rsquo;s thinking about what it means to live a &lsquo;successful&rsquo; life. Change that, and the world looks like a different place.

Now you can fly to Marrakech with&nbsp;easyJet&nbsp;direct from Bristol, with flights on Tuesday and Saturday that are ideal to make a long weekend or short break. Here&rsquo;s our guide to all that you can enjoy in your long weekend. Where to stay If you only have a few days, you&rsquo;ll probably spend most of that time around the old walled city or Medina, so it makes sense to stay in a riad;&nbsp;a traditional Moroccan town house that would typically be home to an extended family and is built around an internal courtyard with a roof terrace for relaxation. Most riads are small with four to eight bedrooms, so you&rsquo;ll get the personal service and help of the Riad staff who can also act as your guide and concierge and arrange any extra services you require such as home-cooked meals or an in-house hammam treatment. The most luxurious of riads can be hidden behind an unassuming doorway down a scruffy alleyway and they provide an oasis of calm when you return exhausted from sightseeing and bargaining in the souks. Check out the&nbsp;Marrakech-Riad&nbsp;riads and the luxurious Josephine Baker themed&nbsp;Riad Star&nbsp;where we stayed, or the&nbsp;Hip Marrakech&nbsp;collective, where you&rsquo;ll find a riad for all tastes and budgets. Getting around Inside the Medina the lanes are too narrow for cars so you&rsquo;ll see donkeys transporting goods around or people wheeling wooden carts. Walk on one side of the street to avoid being run down by motorbikes and if you have an iPhone, you&rsquo;ll find the interactive GPS map on the free&nbsp;Marakech-Riad appinvaluable to find your way in the twisting alleyways. A fun way to go sightseeing is to take a horse and carriage ride around the outer streets of the medina to see the old city walls and gates. This can be arranged by your hotel or riad at a fixed price, or check the price with them so you know roughly what is fair when bargaining a price for one of the carriages lined up to one side of the main square Jemma El Fnaa. Outside the Medina a &ldquo;petit taxi&rdquo; is the best way to get around. These have meters but in the main tourist spots the driver will resist using them, so you should agree a price in advance and most shorter journeys around town should not be more than 20 Dirham.</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.424047684896905','-2.608281170141595',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

It sits to the southern edge of the New Forest National Park and this area is a wonderful place to visit for a short break away anytime of the year.\r\nThe town is famous as a sailing resort with two large marinas and sailing clubs with an open air seawater swimming pool close by for those sunnier months of the year. For a small town there&rsquo;s a surprising number of interesting independent shops and at the bottom end of the High Street you can follow the cobblestone road that leads to the pretty Old Town Quay which is still used as a base for commercial fishing boats.\r\nSeasonal boat trips around the Solent can be taken from the quayside and private sailing and fishing trips can usually be arranged at short notice. If you want to venture further afield the Wightlink ferry sails from Lymington to Yarmouth on the Isle of Wight. However, needless to say, the many attractions of the New Forest are close at hand.\r\nThe perfect escapeOur short break to Lymington was relaxing and stylish with fantastic food &ndash; thanks to Stanwell House Hotel, a cosmopolitan boutique hotel situated in the high street. My wife and I experienced a warm welcome from the hotel&rsquo;s friendly, helpful team. Robert Milton and Victoria Crowe are proprietors and it was clear from their daily &lsquo;hands on&rsquo; approach that maintaining the very high standards of this hotel are a top priority.\r\nGuest roomsThe rooms at Stanwell House are all en suite and somewhere you can kick back and truly relax. All rooms have been individually designed with all the extras needed for a memorable stay and the personal touches certainly stand out. Rooms have complimentary tea, coffee and mineral water, direct dial telephones, 26&rdquo; flat screen TVs with a good channel choice, plus radio, trouser press and hair dryer. Complimentary WiFi is available in the rooms and public areas, just ask at reception for the code. Choose from Four Poster Rooms, Georgian Rooms, Suites and Garden Rooms which are also dog friendly! Some of the rooms are dedicated family rooms or adjoining and children are made to feel welcome here.\r\nI took the opportunity during my stay to have a look at a selection of the different types of rooms and they were all of a very high standard. Our room overlooked the high street, was tastefully designed with a separate sitting area and a spacious luxurious bathroom with a bath and separate walk in shower. And I have to agree with my wife&rsquo;s comment that the bed was one of the most comfortable she has slept in.\r\nDiningGreat food and warm hospitality most certainly, but so much more. From a great breakfast, lovely afternoon tea to a superb dinner dining experience. We dined in the restaurant at the front of the hotel for both nights of our stay. This restaurant is modern, airy, elegant, well laid out and a pleasure to dine in and has AA 2 rosettes for culinary excellence. Other awards include a hotel AA 3 star rating, the New Forest Marque for the use of locally sourced food and Trip Advisors Certificate of Excellence for the last two years running.\r\nThere are two separate dining styles at Stanwell House &ndash; Seafood at Stanwells and the Bistro. I chose to dine from the Bistro menu on our first night and Seafood on the second. The menu was extensive and the taste, quality and presentation were superb, supplemented by an excellent wine list. The service was first class and couldn&rsquo;t be faulted.\r\nSeafood at Stanwells takes advantage of the wealth of fresh produce available on their doorstep &ndash; freshly caught fish and shellfish prepared and served with the emphasis on flavour and quality. The &aacute; la Carte Bistro menu offers a wide choice of contemporary European food again of a very high standard and quality.\r\nBreakfast was a great way to start the day with a full choice of continental or the popular New Forest cooked breakfast. The hotel also offers an anytime menu with a variety of lunches, snacks, coffees and afternoon tea in the elegant conservatory just off the main reception area.\r\nDrydock is the name of the hotel bar at the front of the hotel looking out on to the High Street where you can choose from an extensive drinks and cocktail menu and relax on the soft and comfortable sofas.\r\nOffersSpecial stay and dine options are available along with seasonal offers and these can be seen on the Stanwell House website along with details of room upgrades and the five nights for the price of four offer.\r\nOut and aboutAs I mentioned earlier there&rsquo;s lots to see and do in this area and no doubt a trip into the New Forest will feature highly on your list. The hotel has their own Twizy car. This is an environmentally friendly electric two seater which can be hired for half a day or a full day &ndash; an ideal way to explore the New Forest as you can get up to 50 miles on a full charge. Bookings can be made at reception and the car is conveniently located in Stanwell&rsquo;s own private car park.\r\nAdditionally you could really push the boat out by chartering the yacht Indulgence of Lymington. This is a luxurious 40ft yacht, which can carry eight passengers plus the skipper and one other crew member. How about a lazy sailing day in the Solent with friends?. You can see images of the yacht and more details on StanwellHouse.com\r\nIf you&rsquo;re looking for a super break away from the ups and downs of everyday life and to &lsquo;recharge the battery&rsquo; then Stanwell House in Lymington ticks all the right boxes. This is a top boutique hotel and a great place to stay where there&rsquo;s a friendly welcoming team and sensational food.

Some say Greeks came here and built a temple called Hellas, but this is disputed by local historians who say the Greeks only got as far as Devon. Others believe that Christians visited on a pilgrimage and made their home here.\r\n&ldquo;Then of course there was the Black Death where corpses were buried in the tumuli. Basically nobody knows why it is called Hell but it&rsquo;s a beautiful place,&rdquo; says Shige, who purchased the holiday business with its three cottages in 1996.\r\n&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very much an international business with 20% of holidaymakers coming from abroad as far away as India and many French and Germans regularly staying. It&rsquo;s only a 12-hour drive from Munich.&rdquo;\r\nI have driven through Chideock on the way to Devon many times and never really given it a second glance. Until now. And it is a beautiful revelation. A typical village with narrow country lanes that at times are so narrow it is scary especially when driving a large Range Rover, which seems to create its own lay-bys.\r\nWhat brings a Japanese man to this remote part of Dorset?\r\n&ldquo;Diana was an English teacher in Tokyo and we moved back to the UK. I haven&rsquo;t visited Japan since but my sister sends her children over every now and then,&rdquo; he says.\r\nShige taught Japanese at the University of London and then relocated to Newcastle where he worked for a Japanese company.\r\n&ldquo;I turned their loss-making office into a profitable one. It&rsquo;s only at that point when you&rsquo;re making money that you have the luxury to reflect on what you are doing. Realising that I wanted a better quality of life we moved to Dorset and found Hell. We&rsquo;ve never looked back.&rdquo;\r\nIt&rsquo;s such an idyllic location where there is an almost continual happy bird song; it&rsquo;s as if you&rsquo;re living in an aviary. There&rsquo;s no road noise and children are well catered for because not only is there a large garden to run around there is a slide and swings, which Harriett and Heidi thoroughly enjoy. There&rsquo;s also an enormous games room where we visit each morning. The children love playing in the Wendy house and we even manage to play poll and ping pong.\r\nWe stay in Rosemary Cottage, which has two bedrooms and a downstairs bathroom. Most importantly of all, the beds are extremely comfortable providing a good night&rsquo;s sleep. But it is only on this holiday that my wife Caroline realises that my snoring has been disturbing her sleep for the past three years. That&rsquo;s a tough day for me but I resolve to visit a pharmacist and find some anti-snoring strips, which help.\r\nShige cooks Japanese cuisine and delivers it to the cottages. He&rsquo;ll even take away the plates so there&rsquo;s no washing up. This is great because it enables tired parents to enjoy the restaurant experience at home without worrying about the children disrupting fellow diners.\r\n&ldquo;I also cater for diners in my home and sometimes they end up holidaying in one of my cottages,&rdquo; says Shige. We try the salmon and chicken teriyaki, which comes with rice, miso soup and salad with Japanese dressing. Until now I hadn&rsquo;t eaten seaweed but it was surprisingly tasty in the miso soup.\r\nAnother highlight of this holiday is our trip on the historic Seaton Tramway. We board at Colyton and enjoy a 30-minute trip to Seaton. Surprisingly we&rsquo;re able to fit our tandem pushchair on board in the open part of the tram. Admittedly it&rsquo;s a bit chilly at 10.30am but Harriett and Heidi are covered in blankets so they&rsquo;re happy.\r\nIt&rsquo;s a delightful way to travel to Seaton with breathtaking views of the River Exe estuary. We spot rabbits and pheasants. A thoroughly enjoyable day is spent at Seaton where we become aware that this seaside town suffers from a seagull problem. Interestingly, bird control comes in the form of a 246mph peregrine falcon named Morgan, who is a television celebrity. The moment he is released the seagulls quickly disappear.\r\nOur return journey to Colyton is much warmer. Travelling in this way is so much more relaxing than driving a car and having to look for a parking space.\r\nThere are so many attractions and places to visit along the Jurassic Coast, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Venture down the road to Golden Cap and you will be richly rewarded with magnificent coastal views. From seaside destinations such as West Bay to Lyme Regis and Bridport, and just over the borders to Sidmouth in Devon and Chard in Somerset, there is never a dull moment.\r\nAt the Donkey Sanctuary at Sidmouth, 15,500 donkeys and mules have been provided with a sanctuary for life since 1969 when Dr Elisabeth Svensden MBE established it. The 400-acre site is home to around 350 rescued donkeys. It is open 365 days of the year and is free to visit.\r\nA la Ronde, the National Trust property at Exmouth is a spectacular 16-sided house. It was built by two wealthy cousins who wanted to make the most of daylight. The property enabled them to move around it with the movement of the sun. The same family had lived there from the late 1700s until the 1990s. Furniture includes a chair presented to them by their friend Lady Nelson. This chair had actually belonged to one of Lord Nelson&rsquo;s ships.

Started in the Netherlands 10 years ago and growing from a handful of farms in the UK to over 50 now, chances are there&rsquo;s one a stones&rsquo; throw from you and here in Bristol we have several choices, of which Warren Farm in Somerset is the best. Situated around 40 minutes south 0f Bristol and perched proudly on top of Cheddar Gorge, the family run farm is the stuff children&rsquo;s books are made of. The Good Life if you like and it&rsquo;s yours to enjoy a taster weekend of, without needing to commit to the downsides of living in a farm in the middle of nowhere! Beautifully crafted wooden/canvas tents, complete with proper beds, toilet and wood burner, are tucked away in a pretty field with free roaming hens (whose eggs you can help yourself too), some goats and piglets (depending on the time of year) and fantastic views across the Mendips. The livestock farm, run by Kate and James with a little help from their two children, also has a herd of cows, sheep (and lambs in Spring) and a friendly dog. Visitors are offered a farm tour on weekends, ahead of a Saturday pizza night gathering with home-made pizzas (well self-topped pizzas) cooked to perfection in the traditional outdoor stone oven by James. You&rsquo;re invited to wash this down with all the local scrimpy style cider you can manage, and we&rsquo;re not talking a hairs on your chest apple beverage here, it&rsquo;s delicious and moorish. The tent itself feels more like a cabin&hellip;until the high winds on top of the Mendips take hold, then, in a &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sheltered from the storm on the top of a mountain&rsquo; kind of way you remember where you are. It has a comfy double bed with a mattress, bunk beds and a very cosy bed in a cupboard &ndash; not as meagre as it sounds! There&rsquo;s a sofa and beautiful table and chairs, wood burning stove with chimney out of the tent, kitchen sink and flushing toilet. It&rsquo;s camping, without being totally back to basics &ndash; the charm without the hassle. It&rsquo;s the perfect environment to relax, play some board games and enjoy a local Cheddar Ale, which you can buy from the honesty shop &ndash; that&rsquo;s right, the honesty shop, a larder full of delicious food and drink and other necessities which you help yourself to, keep a note of and pay at the end of the weekend. The Honesty Shop is situated next to the shower block, which is not your average campsite shower block &ndash; it has cubicles and hairdryers and, wait for it, heated floors. It&rsquo;s bliss. The site is well placed on the Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, Cheddar Gorge and The Mendips &ndash; as well as day trips into the Gorge with its caves and stunning scenery, there&rsquo;s the UK&rsquo;s smallest city, Wells, a short drive away; it has a fabulous weekend market taking place in the shadow of the cathedral and lots of places to grab a bite to eat. Wookey Hole is a popular haunt (apt word when you consider the Wookey Witch), but at almost &pound;20 a head it can prove a little to pricey for some (us included). A weekend with Feather Down Farm really feels like a break and despite being close to Bristol, feels like a decent Staycation but without all the travelling &ndash; great when you&rsquo;ve got little ones. Your Warren Farm hosts, James and Kate, are very welcoming and as parents themselves, totally understand how to create a family friendly, fun environment &ndash; but they&rsquo;re not averse to other groups and even offer up some barn space for parties when people book the field full of tents, great for reunions and other group getaways!</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.4622428205879','-2.554260939359665',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The Development Control (South and East) Committee yesterday passed a planning application for the Dolphin School in Cheltenham Road to expand into the former Fowlers engineering site at Bath Buildings. An extra 200-plus places at the primary school will be created, doubling the school&rsquo;s size from 210 pupils to 420 by September 2015, and responding to the chronic need for new school places in Bristol. Bristol City Council provided up to &pound;4million last year for the school to expand. At the planning committee meeting yesterday, councillors highlighted the potential for increased traffic congestion in the area once the school is extended, as parents from the outlying areas drove their children to school. Council highways officers acknowledged that congestion would increase, but the benefits of the new school were perceived to be of enough value to outweigh those fears. But the school has come repeatedly under fire for its catchment area, which extends as far as St Andrew&rsquo;s, Bishopston, Westbury Park and Redland, but does not include nearby St Pauls and parts of Montpelier. And it emerged yesterday that the school does not intend to review its catchment area until at least next year. Speaking to Bristol24-7 yesterday, former councillor Jon Rogers said his questions to the school about how they justified their &ldquo;bizarre&rdquo; catchment area had been repeatedly ignored by the school. He said he &ldquo;could not understand why they being so intransigent&rdquo; on the issue and, while not going as far as saying the school was deliberately setting a course of social engineering, added he could not see any reason why the school chiefs wanted to pursue their policy. &ldquo;Bath Buildings is very narrow and so there is much concern about the travel and highways plan associated withthe planning application,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is particularly acute because the catchment area is strange to say the least. &ldquo;Most school catchment areas are based on a circular area around the school, encouraging children within walking or cycling and discouraging driving. &ldquo;The &lsquo;area of first preference&rsquo; extended up to Westbury Park at the request of the council three or four years ago, due to pressure on places in these areas. &ldquo;There was a logic to it at that stage, but new schools have been built so that logic does not apply now. &ldquo;I cannot understand why they [the school] being so intransigent. I am being asked whether it is down to social engineering or prejudice or discrimination. Nobody is saying the school is being prejudiced, but now they are forcing through an area giving first preference to families in Bishopston over children closer in St Pauls. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t think of any reasons why they would do this and the school should be explaining, particularly as it nearly led to their planning application being refused.&rdquo; Dolphin, which as an academy can set its own catchment area, now plans to review its boundaries annually to take account of variations in the pattern of demand. Erica Draisey, executive principal of Colston&rsquo;s Girls&rsquo; School Trust which manages the Dolphin School, defended the plans &ndash; insisting that 80% of the children live within one mile of the proposed new building, while 42% are from an ethnic minority. She added a legal agreement to be attached to the planning permission, which now needs to be signed, will deliver a range of road and pedestrian safety measures locally, the final details of which first need to be agreed with planning and highway officers. The aim is, she said, to ensure the &ldquo;vast majority of the pupils will get to school on foot or by scooter&rdquo;. &ldquo;Naturally we are delighted with the outcome, as this decision should enable us to build a sustainable and innovative primary school in the heart of the city,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Our priority now is to sign up to the legal agreement. Thereafter we intend to consult further with the local community over the provisions and management aims of the School Travel Plan, whose intention will be to introduce a range of measures to encourage pupils and their parents to walk, scooter or cycle to Dolphin School.&rdquo;</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.48309541608042','-2.6013288843749933',NULL,NULL,1,1,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The University and College Union (UCU) said the University of the West of England (UWE) did not respond to a request for the minutes of its remuneration committee &ndash; the body tasked with determining the vice-chancellor&rsquo;s pay rise. Bristol University sent through redacted minutes of its committee. UCU said the decisions made by universities to determine pay increases for vice-chancellors were unaccountable and &ldquo;murky&rdquo;. The report comes as some staff at the two Bristol institutions prepare to take strike action, in which marking of students&rsquo; work will stop or marks will be withheld, from April 28. The action could prevent students from graduating and applying applying for jobs or places in further education. UCU said it wanted to discover why vice-chancellors got such arbitrary pay rises. Last year, the UWE vice-chancellor Professor Steve West received an 11.3% pay rise to take his salary to &pound;267,000. Professor Eric Thomas at the University of Bristol only got a 0.4% rise, although he still enjoyed a &pound;283,000 salary. The University of Bristol was one of the 27 institutions out of 139 that sent through its minutes. However, UCU said it was concerned that the vice-chancellor appeared to have had the final say on his pay for the year. Although the minutes say Eric Thomas indicated he did not think a salary increase was appropriate, the union questioned why a vice-chancellor was influencing the supposedly independent remuneration committee. On average, vice-chancellors enjoyed a 5% pay rise last year, while university staff were offered a rise of 1%. The UCU argues that staff have seen their wages drop by 13% in real terms since 2009. UCU general secretary, Sally Hunt, said: &ldquo;Millions of pounds of public money are spent on vice-chancellors&rsquo; salaries, yet their pay rise is decided behind closed doors with no accountability. &ldquo;The time has come for the lid to be lifted on the murky world of remuneration committees and senior pay in our universities. Students are paying &pound;9,000 a year to study for a degree and they, and the taxpayer, have a right to know why so much of their money is going on paying the vice-chancellor.&rdquo; UWE has, meanwhile, written to all staff warning them of the consequences of taking part in the potential marking boycott later this month. Talks between unions and vice-chancellors&rsquo; representatives are due to take place on April 15. In a letter to staff, UWE said any staff taking part in the action would be breaking their contracts and would have pay withheld. The letter went on to say: &ldquo;Such [strike] action could have a very serious impact on our students, including their ability to progress or secure employment, as well as on the University as a whole.&rdquo;</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.48245400345847','-2.514124904882806',NULL,NULL,1,1,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The &lsquo;Bristol Ideal&rsquo; project will provide teachers with lesson plans, guidance and support, leading to relationships and sex education lessons for every year part of the school curriculum. An estimated 14,000 women and girls become victims of domestic and sexual violence each year in Bristol. The project, funded by Bristol City Council and the office of the Avon and Somerset police and crime commissioner (PCC), will set standards for schools to provide teaching on: Difference between healthy and unhealthy relationships; Knowing where to go to report abuse; How healthy relationships are based on empathy, negotiation, and respect; All forms of domestic and sexual abuse and about coercive and controlling relationships; Understanding gender violence as a cause and consequence of inequality; Each school will have a dedicated &lsquo;domestic abuse champion&rsquo;, providing specialist support for pupils, while staff will be given training provided for free by the Bristol Ideal project team. Mayor George Ferguson said in advance of the launch: &ldquo;Bristol has acquired an excellent reputation for our innovative work tackling domestic and sexual violence, particularly around female genital mutilation, but there is no room for complacency and much more can and must be done. Time and money is always best spent on prevention work and I am delighted that this innovative project will do just that.&rdquo; Cllr Brenda Massey, cabinet member for schools and young people, said that the project was a long-term strategy designed to change cultures. If done well, she added, it could have &ldquo;quite amazing results in the future&rdquo;. MPs from across the political divide are due to attend the launch and support the work being done. Bristol West MP Stephen Williams said domestic and sexual abuse was a violation of human rights and &ldquo;both a cause and a consequence of deep-rooted inequality between women and men&rdquo;. &ldquo;From preventing violence happening in the first place through meaningful culture change, to protecting the victim and empowering women, there is much to be done.

	(170,NULL,2,'Forest Holidays\'Deerpark \'the UK\'s answer to Yosemite\'in Cornwall','forest-holidaysdeerpark-the-uks-answer-to-yosemitein-cornwall','Laura Williams enjoyed a weekend spent in a beautiful cabin in a idyllic UK location with family and friends','<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Driving down the long, winding path to Deerpark, Cornwall, on a dark but dry March evening we had no idea what awaited us at the bottom of the valley (my co-pilot joked we were entering Deliverance country!), but as we passed the tall brooding trees we descended into a whole new world. A world of beautifully designed log cabins nestled in a forest of Christmas trees, a melding pot of wildlife and an inviting den of tranquility; it&rsquo;s really hard to believe this used to be a gunpowder works (more about that later).</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Deerpark, situated nr the delightful seaside town of Looe in Cornwall, is Forest Holidays&rsquo; much-loved South West retreat. Just a two and half hour drive from Bristol, it&rsquo;s a great choice for a weekend break and with cabins which sleep 2-4 starting at around &pound;350 for the weekend over the winter months (that&rsquo;s like &pound;20 per person per night with a full chalet of 6 &ndash; cheaper than some hostels) it&rsquo;s an affordable and thoroughly enjoyable Staycation. That said, we ended our weekend break thirsty for more and could&rsquo;ve quite happily stayed on for the week.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Just as our arrival at the site was a spectacular introduction to the world of Forest Holidays, from the moment we stepped into the cabin we felt the week&rsquo;s stresses disappear as we excitably explored our surrounds, as if we were kids again. Walking in through the front door on the first floor of the Silver Birch cabin we were greeted with floor to ceiling windows &ndash; revealing a balcony with hot tub, overlooking a lake and a forest. Positively idyllic.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The impeccably-designed cabins (which date back over a decade but feel wonderfully modern) are dotted around the site, almost camouflaged with the trees. Venture inside and you&rsquo;ve everything you need, from comfy beds, sofas and a fine dining table and chairs to a fully equipped kitchen, shower and a bath (ours had uninterrupted views from the first floor out over the lake too). There was also a game of Scrabble with the word &lsquo;WELCOME&rsquo; laid out. Nice touch.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">At times, Deerpark genuinely felt like the UK&rsquo;s answer to Yosemite &ndash; deep valleys, impressive trees, including a domineering Redwood, a beautiful lake and trickling streams. It is complimented perfectly by a stone building housing a village-style shop, complete with Cornish cider, local ales, fairings and other Cornish goodies (as well as all the essentials). It also houses a cafe, which serves delicious homemade pizzas, cream teas and more &ndash; all at very reasonably prices. And the staff are a credit to their employers &ndash; friendly and helpful, instantly making you feel at home.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Fortunately for us, we&rsquo;d inadvertently chosen the hottest weekend of the year to-date and enjoyed a weekend of Spring sunshine, but breaks like this could be enjoyed in rain and snow too &ndash; just in a slightly different way. The hot tub remains hot whatever the weather! And the cabins are sturdy and warming (thanks to a lush log burner). For us, we arrived on the Friday night and settled into a night in our home-from-home &ndash; hitting the sack early(ish) in order to be chipper for the obligatory 10am duck race.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The duck race is a firm favourite at Deerpark, with ranger, Martin, launching a bucket of rubber ducks into the crystal clear waters of the main river which runs through the site. With the help of his trusty dogs, he ushers the motley bunch of colourful ducks along as onlookers cheer and sigh (depending on the pedigree of their duck) and pray for a spot on the winning podium. It&rsquo;s a great way to start the day, partially because I won a bottle of Cornish cider &ndash; the icing on the cake!</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">There&rsquo;s always some ranger activities to take part in, from a bush crafts workshop to a two-hour history walk around the site (which also features the Lost Garden of Deerpark, complete with native daffodils in Spring) and a night vision exercise, exploring stars and constellations and bats and owl spotting with night vision goggles. You could happily fill a weekend with this programme, but Deerpark is located near a lot of attractions worth visiting; including the Eden Project, the coastal towns of Looe, Polperro and Fowey as well as Bodmin Moor. It&rsquo;s a great base from which to explore Cornwall and attracts a lot of walkers for that very reason.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The whole break took on that feel of a film &ndash; at times a hearty RomCom, all candles and romance, and at others a family vacation tale (think Dirty Dancing meets The Great Outdoors), series after series of picture-perfect moments and the kind of memories you cling on to forever. With no phone signal, 3G or 4G you&rsquo;re forced to unplug from the complex and demanding world or communication &ndash; which after the initial realisation you&rsquo;re not going to be able to instantly Instagram all the great stuff you&rsquo;re seeing/doing, works in Deerpark&rsquo;s favour and allows you to really relax. I mean REALLY.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Having never been in a hot tub before, I didn&rsquo;t really get what the big deal was. In fact, my only real experience of hot tubs was hearing my neighbours making the most of theirs every night come rain, snow or shine. In a suburban Bristol garden, overlooked by a bunch of houses including mine. Never really saw the appeal. But after dipping my toe in this pristine hot tub on the veranda of our magnificent cabin with its far-reaching views, I finally got it. The only downside is you&rsquo;re only supposed to stay in it for 20 minutes at a time &ndash; c&rsquo;mon!</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">We took this trip with a couple of friends (and two babies), but our neighbours included a couple, a 30th birthday party, a 40th birthday party (both had balloons to attest to this), an extended family and mixed group of young friends. To sum it up, it&rsquo;s a very versatile short break. In fact, while I was still there, I was looking up availability (using the cafe&rsquo;s wifi) for the Forest of Dean site for another break later this year!</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\"><em><strong>Deerpark in Cornwall is one of nine Forest Holidays sites in the UK, with others at the Forest of Dean, Blackwood in Hampshire, Sherwood Forest, Thorpe Forest in Norfolk, Keldy and Cropton in Yorkshire and Strathyre and Argyll in Scotland.</strong></em></p>','','BS4 3EN','51.43084420127416','-2.580987011206048',NULL,NULL,1,0,1,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Our policy has been approved nationally by the Department for Education. In the light of Christine Townsend&rsquo;s attacks, Bristol City Council education officers have also looked closely at it. Their report to last month&rsquo;s Cabinet meeting states unambiguously: &ldquo;The adopted admissions policies are legal and reflect the expectations of the Code of Practice on Admissions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p>It is true that Cathedral Primary School&rsquo;s policy is different from most council primary school admissions arrangements, in that we do not have a narrow geographical catchment area. But that is because we are a Free School and, like all Free Schools, we have a specific vision, well articulated through the application process with the Department for Education. At the centre of this vision is the creation of a school with an enriched musical curriculum, attractive to musically aspirant families who value the skills that the school is committed to developing. It would be a nonsense, therefore, if we restricted admissions to the area immediately surrounding the school: we do not want to exclude any Bristol children from having a chance to be part of this vision.</p>\r\n<p>Accordingly, we accept applications from children across Bristol and from BS postcodes in North Somerset and South Gloucestershire. Realistically, we expect the number from outside the city to be very low &ndash; this year, there is just one child out of 30 in our Reception class who is not from Bristol.</p>\r\n<p>We do all we can to help make the school accessible to families from different social backgrounds and we are proud of our ethnic and social diversity. We provide financial support with transport costs to families receiving free school meals (currently 23% of our children). And our central position means that we are perhaps the most accessible school in Bristol by public transport. In addition, some parents who work in central Bristol but live elsewhere find our location convenient and cost-effective, because they can bring their child with them on their journey to work.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\"><em>So is our policy unfair, as Christine Townsend claims, because some families have to pay for transport? No, of course not. The same applies to many other schools for children of all ages. Unless all children are to be forced to attend the school closest to their home, parents will always have to weigh up the pros and cons of logistics, whether schools are a good match for their children&rsquo;s abilities and many other factors.</em></p>','','BS4 3EN','51.484164417069294','-2.6397810328124933',NULL,NULL,1,0,1,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

The average house price in this part of the world hovers around the &pound;465,000 mark.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">As with many places though it is often better to visit for a little while, to get a taste of how the other half live, and then move on. The joy of travel. It is possible to do just this at Sandy Balls, the five-star award winning 120-acre country estate near Fordingbridge.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">My wife Caroline and I needed a break after our most challenging year, which saw the arrival of second daughter Heidi Louisa, the start of our business and Caroline&rsquo;s dad having a pacemaker. In short, we were frazzled and in need of some relaxation. As I loaded up the car, I wasn&rsquo;t sure it was actually going to be restful though; the amount of luggage my wife and girls took astounded me. But after a few compromises we all eventually just about managed to squeeze into the poor car.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The New Forest is only about 40 minutes from home but it feels like another world regardless of the time of year you visit. We live on a busy main road and in contrast our luxury lodge at Sandy Balls was a tranquil retreat where bird song replaced the noise of roaring traffic and irksome neighbours. We had taken a six-berth lodge in anticipation of Caroline&rsquo;s mum and dad joining us. Her dad though was still recovering from his operation. But the extra room allowed both Heidi and Harriett to have separate bedrooms.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">We checked in at 3pm and soon after unloading, were swimming. At Sandy Balls there are two warm toddler pools and a main pool. We hadn&rsquo;t been swimming since July and it was surprising to see Harriett with her armbands on doing backstroke as soon as she touched the water.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">It would be very easy to stay at the large holiday park and not venture outside because it has its own well-stocked country store, launderette, gym, sauna, pub and restaurant. Pizza in the Piazza offers good quality food in bright and convivial surroundings. It really does provide a welcome break from the baked beans and scrambled eggs typical of Saunders self catering.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Instead we savoured homemade smoked haddock fishcakes followed by duck with plum and red wine sauce accompanied by a pleasant Italian red. A dessert of chocolate fudge cake and a cappuccino to finish was certainly a pleasing treat. So often these days restaurant service leaves much to be desired but at Pizza in the Piazza the staff were cheerful and genuinely interested in their customers. All cutlery and glasses were gleaming, too.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Each night we all slept well on the comfy beds apart from the first night when Harriett fell out of hers. Our lodge coped well with the winter weather, the combination boiler keeping it warm and cosy.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The onsite cycle centre had a host of bicycles available for hire. We opted for a couple of comfort bikes providing upright riding and I towed the trailer with Harriett and Heidi inside. They enjoyed it and Heidi even fell asleep at one point. We toured the surrounding areas of Stuckton and Gorley. Even though we opted for the quickest route, the hills on the return leg really slowed us up and we failed to cover the distance in the suggested time. In parts I had to get off and push because I did not have the strength to pedal uphill with the loaded trailer.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">On our travels we saw New Forest ponies and donkeys freely roaming by the roadside and sometimes in it; a very useful traffic calming measure although slightly tricky to negotiate on two wheels. Road accidents involving these creatures are on the rise. A total of 65 animals were killed or injured between January 1 and the end of September 2013, compared with 50 in the same period last year, so caution is required when driving through the Forest.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Just down the road is Fordingbridge, a quaint market town famous for its Great Bridge, with its seven graceful arches. There is also a statue of its most famous inhabitant, Augustus John, the portrait painter. Harriett and Heidi enjoyed playing on the swings and slides there.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">We returned home more relaxed than we have been for some time after spending quality time together as a family.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Those who have fallen in love with the New Forest after their stay might like to know that it is much cheaper to buy a slice than estate agents would have you believe.

That is the combination on offer from Nissan with its Juke','<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Eye-catching design at an attractive price. That is the combination on offer from Nissan with its Juke, the increasingly fashionable compact sports utility vehicle. There is no denying it, it is a great design that from a distance looks like a three-door but thanks to cleverly concealed rear door handles it is actually a five-door vehicle.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">For under &pound;15,000 excluding VAT it represents extremely good value for money, too.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">It seems to appeal to all generations from the young girl who cycles past and tells her dad how she likes it, through to the middle-aged man who simply stands and stares and the gentleman of senior years who I spot driving his in Weymouth.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Arguably the brown finish of the test vehicle really does lend itself to the design although I feel that cream leather upholstery would compliment this particularly well. As it is, the black cloth seats are comfortable even over a fairly long journey from Hampshire to Dorset.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The raised ride height is always a welcome bonus for me because it gives greater command of the road. It also allows the driver to spot parking spaces that others do not in packed car parks. I find the 1.5 diesel unit pleasantly poky at speeds under 60mph with third gear being very receptive between 30mph and 60mph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Over that speed it proves slower than expected and at times struggles to hold its own while in the outside lane of the motorway. Hills slow it up a bit requiring a change down to fourth gear but it is only a 1.5 litre and a diesel and so overall it does a good job. With hard driving it will return over 40mpg. The best recorded was around 47mpg.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Perhaps surprisingly the Juke really does hold the road and feels like it is on rails when cornering, meaning that it can be driven with gusto even round bends. Rather than simply being an attractive head-turner it is also pleasingly a driver&rsquo;s car helped by the fairly hard suspension.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The n-tec model tested also comes fitted with cruise control which is useful for motorway cruising. The test takes place just after the UK has been badly battered by storms and the Juke copes with the floods admirably. Just down the road from my parents in law there is an enormous flood that has previously shut the road but the Juke makes light work of it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Reversing the Juke is made easier by the camera display on the dashboard. Without that it would be a little tricky due to the design of the rear.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">While we&rsquo;re talking about the rear, it looks a little awkward to me, there is something that could be improved about it but I can&rsquo;t quite put my finger on it. Head on and the side profile both get a firm 10 out of 10 but the rear gets eight.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Inside is well equipped with all round electric windows, air conditioning and sat nav as you can see in the video at testdrives.biz. I also like the bulbous chrome door handles. There is enough room inside for four or five occupants to be comfortable and the boot is large enough for a pushchair.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">A very capable and enjoyable SUV.</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.49875377505607','-2.687331234228509',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Its laser radar systems are a key ingredient.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">I&rsquo;m testing the V40 D3 R-Design, a performance five-door hatchback and it&rsquo;s fitted with an intelligent yet simple to operate cruise control. As you might expect this keeps the car travelling at the desired speed but unlike most systems it also measures the distance of the car in front. This ensures that it keeps the Volvo at a safe distance behind.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">It does this by automatically braking and accelerating thanks to the information relayed by its laser radar. This distance can be changed from reasonably close to quite far away depending on driving conditions.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">In theory this is a valuable tool that should mean that the driver can relax. Not so though. My test takes place in torrential downpours and high winds and I discover that the radar is not infallible. This becomes particularly noticeable while at 70mph round a bend on a dual carriageway. The Volvo is in the outside lane but on approaching the bend there is a car on the inside and the radar picks this up and brakes abruptly despite there being no cars in front of me. This annoys me and I cancel the function.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">On another occasion we are on a straight road and high winds cause a flashing red warning bar on the driver&rsquo;s side of the dashboard to light up &ndash; accompanied by a really loud beep &ndash; for absolutely no reason whatsoever. My sleeping children wake up. High side winds seem to completely throw the radar and despite there being no traffic in front the Volvo brakes sharply from 70mph to 50mph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">That said this cruise control is quite impressive when you bear in mind that it can be set at say 50mph and if a sharp incline appears the resulting gear change does not cancel out the cruise control. Often this is the case in many other vehicles.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Another safety feature is the Blind Spot Information System. There&rsquo;s a little light on the inside of the wing mirror that glows red whenever a vehicle appears in the blind spot. This is useful because the design is prone to blind spots especially at the rear, making it a little awkward to reverse but there are helpful sensors fitted that bleep to alert the driver of nearby obstacles.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">As a driver&rsquo;s car the Volvo is engaging and the R-Design model, which comes with big alloys, a smooth power delivery for a diesel and a low chassis, corners really well. To give it a good run I drive it to Sandbanks, Poole, West Stafford near Dorchester and a lovely little village near Didcot, Oxford. All are places we had not visited before, so why not? With an average fuel consumption of over 65mpg it will easily cover over 600 miles on its 60 litre tank. It is fitted with engine start/stop.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">These relatively long journeys in generally heavy lashing rain allow me to experience the car in the worst conditions. At one point it rains so heavily that even with the wipers on the fastest speed it is impossible to see and thankfully traffic eventually slows to a crawl.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">I find the leather sports seats too hard and not supportive enough for my lower back and there is a disappointing lack of a footrest for the driver&rsquo;s left foot. I struggle with operating the heating because both left and right sides of the car are operated from a single dial near the driver &ndash; the switch that&rsquo;s incorporated has to be pushed once for left and again for right. It&rsquo;s all a bit confusing for a simple soul when they&rsquo;re focusing on the road so luckily my wife is there to operate the more technical things.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">In the back, eldest daughter Harriett quickly learns how to operate the electric windows (while sister Heidi dozes) but it is easy to lock them from the front. This time I remember to engage the child lock on her door.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The boot is large enough for our single pushchair.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">This 150bhp 2-litre diesel is a gutsy car that has enough power when required. Finished to a high standard the sound of the engine can be heard on tick over, which does alert the occupants to the fact that they&rsquo;re in a diesel.</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.46705739396484','-2.609225307714837',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Home to studios, galleries, creative business workspaces and an excellent caf&eacute; Spike Island should be high up on anyone&rsquo;s list of galleries and art spaces in the UK to visit.</p>\r\n<p>Helen has been the director of Spike Island for several years now. Previously she was Curator at the renowned Ikon, Birmingham, where she worked for 5 years on exhibitions and offsite projects as well as the development of Ikon Eastside, a second gallery based in a former factory building in Digbeth, an industrial area of the city.</p>\r\n<p>In 2014 she is a judge for the Turner Prize and the CAS Annual Award, and in 2013 was a selector for the Paul Hamlyn Artist&rsquo;s Awards. She is chair of Visual Arts South West, an advisor for the Bristol Cultural Development Partnership and serves on the acquisition committee for Frac Midi-Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es 2012-15.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How long have you been the director of Spike Island and what attracted you to the role?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I became Director in September 2010, so nearly four years ago. At the time I had a job I loved and wasn&rsquo;t looking to leave particularly, but it felt right. It seemed a fascinating model for a visual arts organisation, with a loyal community of artists in-house, incredible gallery spaces and huge potential for development. It was a moment too in which many people were trying to figure out how you could sustain artists outside London and Spike felt like an answer to that. It&rsquo;s interesting to see how many new organisations in regional cities across the country are adopting the same model now.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Spike Island is home to some very highly regarded artists such as Louisa Fairclough and Richard Broomhall who have received high praise in the national press as well as specific art publications. How does Spike attract artists of such a high calibre?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mostly artists hear us about through word of mouth; with Louisa, our former curator had seen an exhibition of hers and encouraged her to apply when she heard that she planned to move to Bristol. UWE&rsquo;s Fine Art BA course is also strong and as it&rsquo;s based in the building, we get a lot of applications from graduates. A good art school is a crucial ingredient for a great arts scene.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What criteria are used re. studio space at Spike Island. Can anyone hire a studio there?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Essentially we&rsquo;re looking for promising artists at any stage of their career who we believe will make the most of the resources here. Anyone can apply and decisions are made by a panel including existing studio artists and myself. While we&rsquo;re clear about what we&rsquo;re looking for, it&rsquo;s never quite the same twice.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">How do you feel Spike Island supports its artists with studios in situ?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The exhibitions programme is important &ndash; the art world is global, so ideas change quickly and constantly. As an artist you have to find a way to be part of the larger conversation, or at least to have an awareness of it. Seeing plenty of new work, from Britain and overseas is essential. We also return 10% of studio rents to the artists themselves to enable them to self-organise activity and run a separate Associates programme that&rsquo;s focussed on developing artists and building their networks.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">As well as being home to numerous artists working in various media Spike Island also has a writer in residence, initially the Dundee International Book Prize nominee Amy Mason and currently Holly Corfield-Carr. Whose idea was it to have a writer in residence and how do you feel Spike Island assists them?</strong></p>\r\n<p>It was something I wanted to do. Writing and art making are so closely aligned; they&rsquo;re all about giving form to our experience and to me they&rsquo;re at their most exciting when they&rsquo;re struggling to articulate new experiences in the contemporary world. There was no existing support structure for young writers in Bristol either. We&rsquo;ve been able to give Holly and Amy time and space to work and to help them apply for funding. Amy wrote her novel Ida here, in a former ladies loo that for a while she turned into a museum of objects allegedly owned by her protagonist; we&rsquo;re thrilled that she&rsquo;s now up for the Dundee prize. Holly was recently commended by the Faber New Poets award; we were able to organise a residency in Ireland for her. We also launched a monthly book club, Novel Writers, with the Festival of Ideas, which introduces debut novelists. Bristol based writer Nathan Filer was our most recent guest, and he talked about his Costa book prize winning novel The Shock of the Fall, which is largely based in the city. Bristol has a wealth of talented young writers.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What do you believe sets Spike Island apart from other artist spaces and galleries?</strong></p>\r\n<p>For artists, it&rsquo;s not just a gallery but a whole ecosystem. And for audiences, well, there are few places where you can see an exhibition, then end up sharing a table with the artist in the caf&eacute; or pop to their studio for a look at work in progress. It&rsquo;s a very special place.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">What events at Spike Island and beyond should Bristol 24-7 readers put in their diaries?</strong></p>\r\n<p>You should come to our next opening at 6pm on 11 July. We&rsquo;ve developed an exhibition with French artist Aurelien Froment that includes a collaboration with the wonderful Italian designer Martino Gamper. Openings are great ways to see exhibitions in a social environment, which is code for &lsquo;with a glass of wine in your hand&rsquo;. And the next Novel Writers takes place on 17 July with Lauren Owen, author of The Quick.</p>\r\n<p><strong style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Which artists alive or dead would you like to have studios at Spike Island?</strong></p>\r\n<p>All the lost, anonymous ones. I&rsquo;d love to hold a convention at which we could bring back the cave painters, the makers of Ancient Egyptian and Etruscan sculptures, of the chalk drawings in the British landscape, the women who embroidered the Bayeux Tapestry, the architect of the Pantheon. There are so many questions to ask them. And I&rsquo;d love for them to find out what&rsquo;s happened to art since and to see what they made of it all.</p>\r\n</div>','','BS4 3EN','51.449141604851725','-2.5889692652343683',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

On the motorway (the M4, over the Severn Bridge) it was very capable, happily cruising at 70mph, even though it is heavily laden with five passengers and luggage. Cruise control makes life so much easier on such travels and the electric child lock engaged by the click of a switch on the driver&rsquo;s door is easy to operate.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The one-way streets, invariably up sharp inclines in this part of the world, certainly cause the tired motorist some confusion but thank goodness I&rsquo;m driving the 5008 because the auto box makes light work of the hills. I&rsquo;m not usually a fan of electronic handbrakes but the one fitted to this vehicle is quick and simple to engage and disengage.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Inside, the Allure benefits from an enormous panoramic glass roof (with electric sliding cover), which makes the vehicle really light and airy. The front passengers get captain style seats with pull down armrests that can be adjusted to the desired height. The driver&rsquo;s seat is certainly comfortable, hardwearing and supportive although I do find that when my daughter&rsquo;s baby seat is in place behind I cannot push my seat back quite as far as I might desire.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">There are all the gadgets the modern day motorist could dream of including sat nav, a useful head-up display showing the speed and ensuring the driver doesn&rsquo;t take their eyes off the road. Air conditioning and a good quality sound system are all part of the package.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">I like the way that the centre of the dash, with all the controls for the air conditioning, slopes forward at an angle towards the windscreen, in quite a futuristic way. I also find the mirror above the rear view mirror useful for keeping an eye on our cheeky little daughters behind.</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.4405288280076','-2.5760088312744074',NULL,NULL,1,1,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00');

Her tendency to ask the unaskable directly of her interviewees and lack of the traditionally English tendency to social embarrassment&nbsp;-she famously asked Jimmy Savile if the rumours about his &ldquo;liking young girls&rdquo; in one interview&nbsp;-&nbsp;led to her acquiring the soubriquet &lsquo;Demon Barber&rsquo;.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Once a fixture at the Independent on Sunday and the Observer and now writing for the Sunday Times, her career began post university at the men&rsquo;s magazine &lsquo;Penthouse&rsquo;. &nbsp;Her career arc was one of many subjects touched upon in this candid talk and Q&amp;A&nbsp;session.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The talk which took interview form and was led by Jenny Lacey, began with a frank discussion of the relationship Barber had with a much older conman when she was a schoolgirl and which she documented in her first memoir &lsquo;An Education&rsquo;, which was &nbsp;adapted for the cinema in 2009 and starred Carey Mulligan.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Barber did not shrink from any of the questions asked about this and her honesty about the conman&rsquo;s effect upon her was impressive and unusual. Her admission that she did realise in later years that not only had she been &lsquo;groomed&rsquo; by him so had her parents was slightly eyebrow-raising as was her casual and relaxed approach to her promiscuity at Oxford.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Barber&rsquo;s candour about her relationships was unexpected and unusual, especially her blunt assessment of seeing her husband-to-be and deciding she was going to marry him, at first sight, and adapting her life path in order to do so.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">When discussing her career, Barber appeared a truly formidable and yet empathic woman. She detailed her work processes when she is commissioned to interview someone, initially beginning with research and much of it, creating a list of questions which she can fall back on, transcribing the interview herself which is where the angle she is taking is pondered and finally writing it up.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">She admitted she hates the interview experience and finds it immensely stressful and worries about whether it will prove fruitless and uninteresting, yet does not worry if the subject of the interview dislikes her. She did elaborate on this during the questions and answers session when someone asked if she allows interviews to develop organically. &nbsp;Here she stated that she does not allow her list of questions to dictate the shape of an interview or where it is going ultimately &ndash; that cannot be predicted or controlled it must be permitted to follow the most interesting path.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The anecdotes Barber told about interviewing the likes of Shane McGowen (The Pogues) and Bob Guccione were interesting and amusing. Yet an element of pathos emerged when she was revealed that she felt she missed a number of hints about Nureyev and his imminent death due to AIDS when she interviewed him and that certain revelations about interviewees which came to light at much later dates could not be included as they did not have substantive evidence. However, in the case of Jimmy Saville she felt that by at least putting the idea out there she was able to raise her reader&rsquo;s awareness of the rumours.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">An hour in the company of Lynn Barber was a thoroughly pleasurable way to start an evening, she was eloquent, articulate and you believed completely honest and open. &nbsp;It was entirely clear why she is such a successful interviewer and such a pleasure to read. She takes risks and is direct, clear and has a fierce intelligence, and is even now in these times of shock and schlock journalism an erudite force to be enjoyed on a number of levels. Long may the Demon Barber continue to dissect celebrities and peel back their surprising layers to get to the person beneath.</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.44668097722482','-2.5409040796874933',NULL,NULL,1,1,0,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

Two words that, for me, best describe the Honda CR-V. Fun because this all-wheel-drive vehicle can tackle most terrains while the 150bhp 2.2 litre diesel unit has enough oomph to travel from 0 to 60mph in a little over 10 seconds.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">I&rsquo;m testing the top-of-the-range &pound;33,000 plus 2.2-litre four-wheel-drive version. As I look down the side panels I&rsquo;m instantly struck by how this fourth generation model reminds me of the BMW X5. It looks grander, more striking and capable than its predecessors. I like the polished metal finish. Eldest daughter Harriett likes the way water jets clean the headlights at the push of a button.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">In fact this sports utility vehicle (SUV) is fitted with a number of luxury features including the power tailgate that makes light work of closing the boot, extremely easy to fold rear seats and a panoramic glass roof.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">My test takes in Dorset, Hampshire and Oxford. A selection of artists have opened their studios and so it is an ideal opportunity to go and visit them. Interestingly the route is pretty much a straight run from Oxford down to Dorset and we are able to take in an average of three studios a day, racking up just over 500 miles and returning at best 39.7mpg at a constant 56mph.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">As temperatures drop to minus figures in the winter months it is reassuring to be driving a vehicle that is fitted with permanent four-wheel drive, especially when visiting the remote parts of the country that our trip takes us to. In fact on a number of occasions we find ourselves parking in farmers&rsquo; fields to visit the studios and the CR-V makes extremely light work of such requests. Hill descent is a useful feature too enhancing its capabilities when tackling such scenarios.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The black leather interior is comfortable and the power front seats are easy to operate, although the driver&rsquo;s seat does seem to remember a different position on locking the vehicle. This is no doubt down to me not setting my desired position on the memory function. Similarly my wife and I find the radio frustrating because it refuses to play our favourite station, bypassing it at every request.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The automatic gearbox is smooth.

The five-seat SUV has been in production since 1995 and has proven incredibly popular for the Japanese manufacturer. Indeed, five million CR-Vs have gone to happy homes around the world. Its blend of practicality, reliability and efficiency has stood it in good stead, but competition from the likes of Mazda&rsquo;s CX-5, Nissan&rsquo;s X-Trail and even BMW&rsquo;s X3 means Honda really has to be on its toes to retain its share of the market.&rdquo;</p>','','bs23 2pj','51.35073621942768','-2.979205088499384',NULL,NULL,1,0,1,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

It wasn&rsquo;t as good as Raimi&rsquo;s, but it wasn&rsquo;t a total disaster either.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The Amazing Spiderman 2 gives us more of the same. More, in fact, of everything. More back-story about Peter Parker&rsquo;s parents, more villains, more romance, more special effects, more spectacular city-destroying action. There&rsquo;s a prevailing and niggling sense of de ja vu with it all, exacerbated by the fact that practically every week ushers in the cinematic unleashing of a new Marvel movie. A certain case of the law of diminishing returns.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">It doesn&rsquo;t help that director Webb seems so often split as to which story he really wants to tell. On one hand it&rsquo;s a romance, sprinkled with the angst and torment of teen love and Parker&rsquo;s inevitable realisation that his web-slinging alter-ego will inevitably pose a threat to those he loves the most.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The emotional epicentre of the Spiderman mythology has always been the love story, whether it&rsquo;s Mary-Jane or Gwen Stacey. Admittedly, the dynamic between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone works well, blending the kooky, lanky, charming awkwardness of Parker with the head-strong academic beauty of Stacey. They over-play it a little here, but there&rsquo;s an undeniable charm and chemistry with their interplay. There are also a few unexpectedly moving scenes between Peter and Aunt May (Sally Field) that deliver a surprisingly emotional wallop.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">But if Marvel on celluloid is defined by anything it&rsquo;s the ability to deliver action-packed set-pieces and villains that kick monumental ass &ndash; and Spidey 2 delivers in bucket loads.<br />Jamie Foxx&rsquo;s Max Dillon is set up as Oscorp&rsquo;s gap-toothed, bespectacled nerdy lackey who transforms into Electro after plunging into a gigantic vat of mutant electric eels. Electro himself growls, snarls and hurls bolts of electric charges from his fingertips in his destructive skirmishes with our webbed wonder, yet visually he seems a twisted, sparkling, translucent love child of Dr Manhattan from Watchmen and Mr Freeze.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Dane DeHaan plays Harry Osborn as a convincing pal to Parker, rekindling an old friendship in earlier scenes of affecting psychological drama that ultimately degenerate into inane grinning and cackling when he finally &ndash; and all to briefly &ndash; falls victim to an hereditary mutation that make him the Green Goblin. Paul Giamatti even makes an appearance in the very first and last five minutes as a deranged Russian mobster and his eventual alter-ego Rhino. As with Raimi&rsquo;s Spiderman 3, it comes occasionally dangerously close to packing in too many bad guys. More bang for your buck certainly, but at the expense of fleshing any of them sufficiently out.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">And therein lays another problem: the length. You always like to feel you&rsquo;re getting value for money &ndash; and you certainly do during the many frenzied, CGI-led action sequences (and with a reported budget of $200m the money&rsquo;s definitely up on the screen) &ndash; but with a running time of 142 minutes it would have benefitted from a judicious editorial trimming. Scenes are padded out and extra characters are briefly introduced and just as quickly excised, and the whole thing could have been snipped to fashion a punchier, tighter film.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The 3D is nevertheless absolutely spectacular, pushing the boundaries and gob-smacking effectiveness of the format to new and thrilling limits, sweeping us through the city&rsquo;s skyscrapers and inducing a giddying, exhilarating rush as Spidey web-slings his ways from one heroic action set-piece to another. It&rsquo;s also employed in more subtle and effective ways too, exploiting the medium&rsquo;s potential for unexpected visual depth for scenes inside the sanctum of Oscorp itself and a disused subway station.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The Amazing Spiderman 2 then, is something of a mixed bag, its own disparate web of intrigue. It certainly delivers on the thrills and spills and a more hit than miss interplay with its romantic leads, but it does beg the question of whether it was all absolutely necessary.<br />As with the recent glut of Marvel flicks there&rsquo;s also the inevitable realisation it&rsquo;s something of a teaser for a whole slew of other adaptions and spin-offs currently in the pipeline, chief amongst them The Sinister Six.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">So there&rsquo;s a lot here that&rsquo;s really done before and some scenes could have in fact been cut and paste from previous Spidey adventures. That said, there are plenty of thrills and spills amidst the expositional sojourns, and it&rsquo;s occasionally a perky, funky, vibrant take on the character&rsquo;s mythology.</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.46636228553551','-2.5787554133056574',NULL,NULL,1,0,1,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

It&rsquo;s the franchise that just keeps giving. You might also be forgiven for thinking that the whole superhero conceit is starting to wear a bit thin, and the oh-so regular tranche comic book film forays are running out of steam and imagination.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">That couldn&rsquo;t be further from the truth here &ndash; and to a large extent the entire Marvel world, as its characters span a diverse range of genres &ndash; as Captain A is shifted to a new genre himself: the 70s spy espionage thriller.<br />And who better to usher into the comic enclave than 70s icon Robert Redford as suave S.H.I.E.L.D top man, Alexander Pierce, who adds a weight, occasionally chilly gravitas. Directors the Russo brothers even throw in a few neat 70s references, including a nod to the brainwashing scene from the Manchurian Candidate and a few shots of the Watergate building.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">It&rsquo;s a slick, bold action-adventure film that has Steve Rogers chiselled out as a character who would now sit more comfortably alongside the likes of Jack Ryan or Jason Bourne, manoeuvring his way through series of cross and double crosses and twisty, labyrinthine plots in which he doesn&rsquo;t know who to trust or who to believe, even himself. Things are darker, more noir-ish and insidious than before &ndash; at least for three quarters of the film anyway &ndash; a perilous search to weed out the enemy from within.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Recently, the Marvel universe has exploited the idea that the characters interweave and relate to each other in their vast, inter-dependent universe, hopscotching in and out of each other films with casual, party-crashing abandon.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Here, however, it feels like a completely independent movie that can stand on its own two feet without any particular knowledge (though admittedly a little bit would help) of anything that&rsquo;s gone before it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Kicking off with a thrilling rescue mission on board a hijacked ship, it soon becomes clear to ol&rsquo; Cap that something strange is afoot, with Samuel L Jackson&rsquo;s Nick Fury revealing the organisations plans to launch a series of heli-ships armed with an eye-popping array of weaponry under the guise of protecting the universe and predicting crimes &ndash; Minority Report pre-crime style &ndash; before they happen. But duplicitous machinations and shadowy dealings soon surface, throwing Rogers&rsquo; into a cat-and-mouse chase and as a fugitive on the run.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">What adds an extra dimension and further dramatic scope is that the whole movie doesn&rsquo;t solely hang on Captain America himself. Amidst the action &ndash; and there&rsquo;s plenty of it &ndash; there&rsquo;s also breathing space for the development of other key characters.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Scarlett Johansson&rsquo;s Black Widow and Samuel L Jackson&rsquo;s Nick Fury get satisfyingly meatier roles, making it more of an ensemble superhero piece, yet with the Captain still the bonding agent that keeps the whole troupe together. Chris Evans throws in a nice turn as the Captain, charming, complicated, with depth, emotion, heart and soul.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">If there&rsquo;s a slight problem then it&rsquo;s with Anthony Mackie&rsquo;s fellow S.H.I.E.L.D soldier Sam Wilson who, quite late in the film, dons a hi-tech prototype exoskeleton that sprouts mechanical wings to become The Falcon. It&rsquo;s not the best of characters anyway, and its CGI execution is slightly clunky and awkward, feeling more like he&rsquo;s yet another character thrown into the Marvel milieu just for the sake of it.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Surprisingly too, the metal-armed cyborg Winter Soldier of the title doesn&rsquo;t make that much of a menacing mark, not so much an imposing, bad-ass super-villain as more of an inconsequential interloper, popping up a few times to grimace and scowl, but ranking as one of the least formidable bad guys in the Marvel canon so far.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">But these are minor quibbles in a movie that&rsquo;s immense fun, crammed choc-o-bloc full of superbly choreographed, dizzyingly action-packed set-pieces (a full-on, bullet-riddled assault on Nick Fury&rsquo;s car being a thrilling highlight), and interesting, developed character arcs.

He&rsquo;s become a global superhero, the everyman of the action world, and perhaps the most convincing average Joe battling extraordinary circumstances since Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones or Jack Ryan.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The premise to Non-Stop is text book high concept: Bill Marks (Neeson) &ndash; a washed-up, alcoholic, U.S. Air Marshal boards a flight across the Atlantic and receives a series of threatening texts from an unidentified passenger saying someone will be killed every 20 minutes unless $150 million is deposited into an offshore account.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">And so the heat is on, as Neeson whittles his way through the motley crew of passengers to suss out who the real terrorist is. Everyone&rsquo;s a suspect here, catching suspicious glances from potential distrustful passengers, and ticking the boxes of characters that may or may not play an important role later (Muslim doctor, New York cop, nerdy teacher, uncooperative youth).</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">It deftly points us wrong directions, misguides and narratively trips us up, racking up a claustrophobic atmosphere of suspicion and suspense as Nesson relentlessly exchanges texts to catch his man. It&rsquo;s a kind slick narrative combo of Agatha Christie and Cluedo whodunit at 40,000 feet.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">There are a few cracking action sequences, including one fantastic, brutal fight in a locked toilet where there&rsquo;s barely enough room to swing a punch but there&rsquo;s a flurry of jaw-snapping fisticuffs.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Director Juame Collet-Seraa, who also directed Neeson in Unknown, choreographs the set pieces with a slick and stylish flourish, and he&rsquo;s aided by some effective, disorienting cinematography by Flavio Martinez Labiano, and an occasionally pulsating score by John Ottman which accentuates the taut, tense atmosphere. Julianne Moore also comes along for the ride to offer Neeson calming support amidst the unfolding fear and paranoia.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">But the movie&rsquo;s real trump card and saving grace is Neeson,a hulking, grimacing, growling monolith of a man who you&rsquo;re often unsure is going to rough you up or burst into tears. Here he&rsquo;s a broken man, still suffering from the loss of his young daughter, distraught, emotional, totally vulnerable and exposed, yet brimming with frustration, anger and anxiety as he tries to convince passengers of their plight as they start to turn against him.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">He&rsquo;s a commanding, imperious presence with a huge amount of gravitas, full of brooding and melancholy, stomping through the aisles and barking lines such as &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not here to blow up the plane, I&rsquo;m here to save it!&rdquo; with absurdly believable, almost Shakespearean passion. Even his final, personal plea for understanding as he gives a quick synopsis of his life story has an emotional weight and power (&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a good father. I&rsquo;m not a good man. But I want to save this plane.&rdquo;) It&rsquo;s something only Neeson could pull off effectively with such anguished, pained humanity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Ultimately though, this is big, dumb and incredibly fun action fare, a B-movie genre piece writ large and total, occasionally exhilarating, popcorn fodder. Take it for the trashy, nonsensical, outrageous fun that it is, switch your brain into neutral, and you&rsquo;ll have a hell of a good time.</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.472938656804','-2.541333233129876',NULL,NULL,1,0,1,0,NULL,1,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

It isn&rsquo;t log before matters take a turn for the worse and Kermit is kidnapped, sent off to a Russian gulag, and replaced by the mole-faced criminal mastermind, Constantine.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Cognizant from the get-go of the old adage that the sequel is never as good as the original, the prophetic opening razzle-dazzle number &ldquo;We&rsquo;re doing a sequel&rdquo; prepares full-on Muppet aficionados for potential disappointment. They needn&rsquo;t worry though as, while it might not have as much heart, soul and affectionate nostalgia as The Muppets, it&rsquo;s still a madcap, energetic, occasionally self-deprecating globe-trotting crime caper.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">They zip from their first gig in Germany (Die Muppets) to Madrid to Berlin to Dublin, entangling themselves in a cross and double-cross plot as Badguy and Constantine attempt to steal the crown jewels from the Tower of London (cue laser-beam dodging, Mission: Impossible parody). Hot on their heels are Interpol agent, Jean Pierre Napoleon (Ty Burrell, clearly having a whale of a time as the bumbling French agent) and Sam the Eagle.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Taking riffs on a raft espionage thrillers and mistaken identity plots, it breezes through several gut-bustingly funny musical numbers, again penned by Bret McKenzie. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Number One&rdquo; has Constantine literally leap-frogging around the room to an exasperated Gervais, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll Get You What You Want&rdquo; is an hysterical, funky Lionel Ritchie-style groove, and the inspired &ldquo;Interrogation Song&rdquo; is a superbly crafted exposition number that spits its lines with a machine-gun style delivery of the screwball comedy era. Miss Piggy even gets her own Celine Dion ballad.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Kermit&rsquo;s gulag scenes are amusing enough as he tries to hatch a Great Escape-style plan to dig his way to freedom, made even more enjoyable &ndash; and slightly surreal &ndash; by the fact the rag tag band of singing and dancing inmates include the likes of Ray Liotta and Danny Trejo. There&rsquo;s also handful of in-jokes and movie references to keep the parents mildly amused (Kermit being wheeled into the gulag with a Hannibal Lecter mask strapped to his face is a hoot).</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Ricky Gervais is, well, Ricky Gervais, not adding any particular character or depth but serving the story as &lsquo;number two&rsquo; accomplice with his usual gurning, playful schtick. For those familiar with his Office days, he even manages to sneak a grin-inducing David Brent dance move into one of the musical numbers.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">As breezy and mirthful as it all is, however, it does outstay its welcome and could have done with a snip here and there, and it&rsquo;s all rounded off with a predictably moralistic epilogue about the importance of friendship.<br />Nevertheless, it&rsquo;s an infectiously fun, feel-good, occasionally inspired addition to the Muppet movie canon that will entertain the kids and their parents in equal measure.</p>','','BS4 3EN','51.43983331552017','-2.5469980585693293',NULL,NULL,1,0,1,0,NULL,1,'2014-07-04 00:00:01','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

This led to a natural transition to several Broadway musicals.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">He changed his name to Cary Lockwood but quickly changed it because it was similar to another actor&rsquo;s name, after which he changed it to Cary Grant, the reasoning being the initials CG had already proved particularly auspicious for Clark Gable and Gary Cooper.<br />After a long and massively successful film career during which he starred with a star-studded range of actors and actresses and worked with some of Hollywood&rsquo;s top directors, Grant died on 29 November 1986.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">His legacy, however, lives on through the string of unforgettable celluloid masterpieces he starred in. Here are five of my favourites.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\"><strong>His Girl Friday (1940)</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Grant&rsquo;s early movie career comprised of several superlative screwball comedies, and this may well be his best. It&rsquo;s a blistering, relentless, hysterical remake of Ben Hecht&rsquo;s play, The Front Page, about the hysteria and manic madness of the newspaper world.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The dialogue rattles along at a blistering, machine-gun fire pace and the performances by Grant, the spunky, feisty Rosalind Russell, and meek Ralph Bellamy. Grant&rsquo;s the editor, Russell his top reporter and ex-wife, Bellamy the new man in her life who doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance against Grant&rsquo;s incorrigible scheming and manipulation to Russell to cover a high-profile murder scoop and win her back.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Twists, turns, tongue-tying one-liners, gems of physical comedy and top-notch supporting performances make this a bubbly, boisterous, brilliant comedy.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\"><strong>Bringing Up Baby (1938)</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Another quirky screwball comedy offering, here with Grant &ndash; usually charismatic and suave &ndash; as a flustered, absent-minded professor putting together dinosaur bones from an archaeological dig, whilst Katherine Hepburn is the kooky heiress whose pet dog steals the final, vital bone.<br />The movie whips along with gusto and verve in a labyrinthine, convoluted series of madcap escapades and implausibly nonsensical set-pieces. It was a box office failure when it was first released (then again, so was It&rsquo;s A Wonderful Life) but its standing today as one of the greatest screwball farces every made is indubitable. Oh, and the Baby of the title is a leopard.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\"><strong>Charade (1963)</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Another Hepburn &ndash; Audrey &ndash; pairs up with Grant, who here has echoes of characters from lighter Hitchcock roles. Hepburn, recently widowed, is followed by a gang of nasty gangsters in Paris, with Grant allegedly her shadowy protector &ndash; or is he? It&rsquo;s a harmless, fun, frothy caper that also throws in a great performance from Walter Matthau.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\"><strong>Arsenic and Old Lace (1944)</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Grant didn&rsquo;t much like is performance here, though the rest of us Grant fans are in agreement it&rsquo;s one of his frenetic best.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">It&rsquo;s a darker, macabre tale of Mortimer Brewster, recently-married author whose brother&rsquo;s convinced he&rsquo;s Teddy Roosevelt and whose aunts have a worrying predilection for poisoning old men. Brother Raymond Massey and alcoholic Peter Lorre try to dispose of a recently-deceased body, whilst the only thing Mortimre&rsquo;s wife wants to do is start their honeymoon.<br />Deliciously twisted fun from director Frank Capra.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\"><strong>North By Northwest (1959)</strong></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Another spin on Hitchcock&rsquo;s favourite &lsquo;wrong man&rsquo; theme, Grant plays ad man Roger Thornhill who is mistaken for a top spy and then set up for murder. On the run as a fugitive, his quest is to find the real culprit to save his own life. Sexy but mysterious, icy blonde Eve Kendall (Eve Marie Saint) pairs up to help him, but may or may not be as straightforward as she seems.<br />Kinetic, colourful and comic, this is Hitchcock at his mischievous, playful, entertaining best, staging a few (now iconic) set pieces involving a crop duster and a perilous dash across the stone faces of Mount Rushmore.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">James Mason puts in a memorable turn as deadly enemy agent Vandamm, and despite numerous death-defying scrapes, Grant still looks immaculate.

A spin-off, starring Superman&rsquo;s cousin &ndash; Supergirl!<br />Starring the likes of Peter O&rsquo;Toole, Faye Dunaway and Peter Cook (all of whom were clearly strapped for cash), Supergirl attempted to replicate the success of the first Superman movie by surrounding the unknown lead with some famous faces. It didn&rsquo;t work.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">We know what you&rsquo;re thinking: &ldquo;But I love Supergirl! It was great when I was a kid!&rdquo; We grew up loving Supergirl as well, but you have to admit, it&rsquo;s one of the most bizarre, cheap-looking and nonsensical superhero films ever made. Need proof? Just look at the opening scene.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">It starts with Peter O&rsquo;Toole playing Argo City&rsquo;s resident artist and eccentric Zaltar, stealing the city&rsquo;s power source in order to create a tree. Kara (aka Supergirl) then makes a dragonfly using Zaltar&rsquo;s magic wand, which then ruptures Argo City&rsquo;s &lsquo;membrane&rsquo;, prompting Kara to try and retrieve in it an&nbsp;inter-dimensional pod. At least, that&rsquo;s what we think it is. Details aren&rsquo;t important in this film.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Cue some classic dialogue:<br />&ldquo;What is a tree?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;A lovely thing which grows on Earth.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;Earth? You mean where my cousin went?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;And to where one day soon perhaps I might venture as well.&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe you. How?&rdquo;<br />&ldquo;In that. Through there.&rdquo;&nbsp;(We like to think this was improvised on O&rsquo;Toole&rsquo;s part because he couldn&rsquo;t be bothered to spout the rubbish dialogue)<br />&ldquo;The Binary Chute? But you could never survive the pressure. It would destroy you&hellip;&rdquo;</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Still, Peter O&rsquo;Toole at his most lame is still better than 90% of the world&rsquo;s actors. Which brings us to the rest of the cast.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\">Despite throwing money at some of the biggest stars at the time (Dolly Parton was offered $7 million to star as the villain, Dudley Moore $4 million to be her lackey), no one wanted to take part. Rumour has it that Melanie Griffith, Brooke Shields and Demi Moore all turned down the role, until relative unknown Helen Slater was finally cast.</span></p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">While she is perfectly fine in the role, it is a shame that the overall film never saw her career take off. Plus it doesn&rsquo;t help that while she&rsquo;s taking it seriously, everyone else seems to be there for the money or just bemused by the whole thing.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The film went on to under-perform in every possible way. It has the lowest box office returns of any Superman film (just $14 million) and even got Peter O&rsquo;Toole and Faye Dunaway nominated for two Razzie awards.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">It is one reason DC Comics are so reluctant to put money into a female-led superhero film (Catwoman can also take a lot of the blame), but for that reason alone, it stands unique among the plethora of spandex-clad superhero films out there.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">As well as the film, What The Frock! Comedy comedian&nbsp;Amy Howerska&nbsp;will be performing a stand-up set before the film. And with Amy being a card-carrying Supergirl geek, that is something not to be missed!</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The event is on April 24 at 8pm, at The Cuban on Bristol&rsquo;s Harbourside.

Or they are when delivered by Rosie.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">However Nineties Woman isn&rsquo;t solely a stand up show it is very funny but has important points to make about society&rsquo;s approach to sexism and feminism and the issues feminism dealt with back in the mists of time, well the nineties. The show is structured perfectly and has a strong narrative arc and a wonderful twist at the end.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Inspired by finding copies of the old York University feminist newspaper &lsquo;Matrix&rsquo; in her parent&rsquo;s house Rosie decides to track down her fellow contributors and see what &lsquo;Matrix&rsquo; meant to them and what they feel about feminism today and whether anything has changed.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">The majority of the revealing and honest interviews are filmed and the films are curious, perhaps the most comfortable person on camera was the acclaimed comedian Zoe Lyons who was warm, funny and honest about her motives for joining &lsquo;Matrix&rsquo; ie she fancied the charismatic leader &lsquo;Kate&rsquo;. A number of the editorial collective who were lesbians in the Nineties or rather were &lsquo;political&rsquo; lesbians subsequently discarded that identity in the intervening years, much to the bemusement of their peers. This in itself was enough to spark a lively post-show discussion, much later, about nature, nurture, and choice when it comes to sexual identity.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">Feminism and feminists are all too often seen as very, very serious and lacking in humour. This show proves that with the benefit of hindsight this really is not the case. Well certainly not nowadays. Being of an age when I remember the type of women who ran &lsquo;Matrix&rsquo; running &lsquo;Codpiece&rsquo; the radical theatre soc at my old University (still going today) and the LGB society (they didn&rsquo;t like the &lsquo;T&rsquo;s much back then) much of Nineties Woman rang very true indeed. The women took themselves and their feminism and politics VERY SERIOUSLY INDEED unsurprisingly, they were dealing with and protesting big issues.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">However, slightly guilty though I felt, the point where Rosie Wilby read a birthday card from her big crush, the ubiquitous, charismatic &lsquo;Kate&rsquo; which was essentially hippy dippy drivel repeating &lsquo;Deep peace&rsquo; at the start of each line was one of the most amusing things I have seen this year. Closely followed by Rosie&rsquo;s attempt to storm an elitist college ball and the subsequent shock she received whne she did.</p>\r\n<p style=\"font-family: \'palatino linotype\', palatino, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 21px;\">This show doesn&rsquo;t just examine feminism it examines the search for identity and the need to belong and to find kindred spirits. It will strike a chord with anyone who has felt outside the norm, who wants to be cooler than they think they are (note to all teenagers and young people, you&rsquo;re really not as cool as you think) and anyone who was once involved with student politics or had an inappropriate crush or unattainable crush. Well crafted, well researched and making the juncture where the personal met the political funny and yet poignant.</p>','<p>s</p>','BS4 3EN','51.46566716651704','-2.5877676355956964',NULL,NULL,1,0,0,0,NULL,1,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00'),
